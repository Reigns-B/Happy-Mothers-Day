# Happy-Mothers-Day

Who is this Project For?
This is a beginner-level project, and before beginning, you should have some previous knowledge of the Turtle library, such as changing directions, changing colours, and using the penup() and pendown() commands.

Features to Consider:
The program will draw an image of a woman and include the text “Happy Mother’s Day”
We will then draw three stars to the left of the image
On the right side of the screen, we will include the date and a short message.
